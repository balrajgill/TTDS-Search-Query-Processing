THORN EMI, the UK electrical and entertainment group, yesterday reported a
slight fall in profits in the year to March, bolstered by a strong
performance from the music division.
Although the recession hit rental income, group pre-tax profits fell only
from Pounds 258.6m to Pounds 255.1m. Sales were up 8 per cent, at Pounds
3.95bn.
Earnings per share fell from 54.1p to 48.5p. Final dividend is 21.5p, making
a total of 30.1p for the year - up 3 per cent on last year after adjustment
for the rights issue that funded the Pounds 510m acquisition of Virgin Music
Group earlier this year.
The group's decision to pull out of electrical retailing led to a Pounds
42.5m extraordinary charge and a Pounds 20.8m write-off of advance
corporation tax. Disposals of other businesses and the restructuring of
Thames, the television company in which Thorn has a controlling interest,
brought total charges to Pounds 120.1m before an extraordinary gain of
Pounds 34.3m from the sale of the software business to management.
On the operating side, the music business made profits of Pounds 125m, up
from Pounds 109m, on record sales of Pounds 1.13bn after the company bought
the 50 per cent of Chrysalis Records and SBK Records it did not already own.
Thorn will begin to integrate Virgin Music next Monday, on completion of the
purchase.
While sales volume fell, profits rose because of a higher percentage of
sales in higher value CDs.
The decline in consumer confidence and the decision to pass on higher VAT -
unlike competitors Granada - hit the rentals division, where profits fell
from Pounds 139.6m to Pounds 124.2m on sales of Pounds 1.1bn. Tight credit
controls and maintenance of high prices meant the division was a 'tremendous
cash generator', said Mr Colin Southgate, chairman.
Other businesses, including lighting, security systems and defence,
continued to underperform, making only Pounds 52.9m profit - down from
Pounds 69.4m on sales of Pounds 1.07bn, but still about one third of the
group total. In particular, the security division, comprising 23 different
businesses, suffered. New management has been brought in to consolidate the
number of operating centres.
Mr Southgate said that while all the businesses apart from music and rentals
were for sale, the group would only consider offers for entire businesses.
Thorn's share price shed 10p to 835p.
